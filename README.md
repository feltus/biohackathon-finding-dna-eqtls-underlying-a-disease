# Biohackathon Overview

A hackathon is an event, usually hosted by a tech company or organization, where programmers get together for a short period of time to collaborate on a project. The participants work [in teams] rapidly and often work without sleep to achieve their task, as the events generally only last 24 hours or take place over a weekend.

In this event, you will begin to unravel he genetic basis of a human disease.

# When is the event?

The biohackathon will be held on Dec 3 and Dec 5, 2024 from 8am-9.15am.  
Physical Location: Newman Hall 104
Zoom Location: https://clemson.zoom.us/j/9452064261

# Hackathon Objectives

Find genes underlying a human disease.

# Hackathon Tasks
# Task A. Join and connect with your team.

# Task B. Select a disease to study.

* Prometheus prompts *
```
* Provide an overview of DISEASE_X from a clinical perspective.  Be specific on symptoms, diagnostic & * prognostic criteria.
* What are the frontline treatments for DISEASE_X?  What are the criteria for a successful treatment and what are options if the frontline therapy fails?
* From a physiology perspective, what organs are involved in expression of DISEASE_X?
```

# Task C. Find a gene underlying the disease.

* Prometheus prompts *

```
* From a molecular perspective, what genes are associated with DISEASE_X?
* When are these genes normally expressed in development and in what tissue are they expressed?
* When are these genes abnormally expressed in DISEASE_X and in what tissue are they misexpressed?
* What is the molecular function of the genes that are abnormally expressed that lead to DISEASE_X?
* Please provide 3 hypotheses explaining how the misexpression of these genes leads the DISEASE_X.
```
# Task D. Build a protein:protein interaction (PPI) network using the known gene as a seed.

# Task E. Find eQTLs controlling the genes in the correct target tissue. Write a Bash script to parse eQTL file.

# Task F. Write down a hypothesis that the genes caused the disease phenotype by mechanism X.  

Design an experiment to test the hypothesis.

# Task G. Write a report and send it to Feltus.
